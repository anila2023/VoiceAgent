Your policy schedule tells you which sections and limits apply to your cover. Home insurance helps cover the cost if something happens to your home or belongings. You pay us a premium so if something goes wrong, we might be able to help put it right. \u2022 Buildings insurance covers you if something happens to your home. For example, if there's a fire. \u2022 Contents insurance covers you if something happens to your things. For example, if they're damaged by a flood.

We might not be able to pay some or all of your claim if you don't. We won't pay any more for a claim than we would have if you'd have told us straight away. For example, if the damage has got worse because you hadn't told us. 1 Before you contact us If you need to claim, there are some things you might have to do before getting in touch with us. \u2022 Please don't make repairs for any reason other than urgent repairs to stop the problem getting worse. For example, turn the water off at the mains, and call a plumber if there's a leaking pipe. We don't cover the costs to repair the pipe, unless: it was damaged by freezing, or it was damaged by accident and you have Buildings with Accidental damage cover. If you need to make urgent repairs, take a photo before and after. Don't throw away any damaged items until we say so. But it's okay to throw away damaged freezer food, just make a list of it first, and take a photo of it too. \u2022 Call the police if something's been stolen, vandalised, or damaged in a riot. They will give you a crime reference number. Call them if you've lost something away from home, and see if you can get a lost property number. \u2022 If something's lost or damaged while travelling, for example, your suitcase on a plane, please report it to the travel company before calling us. \u2022 If you lose a mobile phone, you must tell your service provider right away. \u2022 If someone says you or your family are responsible for an injury or any damage, don't admit blame, or try and negotiate with them. If you do, it might mean we're not able to pay your claim. Please don't reply to any letters or documents from them. Send them to us instead. 2 Contact us Register your claim online 24/7 at: halifax.co.uk/make-a-claim Or call us on 0345 604 6473 Our lines are open 8am-6pm Monday-Friday and 9am-1pm Saturday. Please make sure you have your policy number and email address (if you have one) when you get in touch. 3 What you'll need to give us You must help us look after your claim by doing what we ask. \u2022 We'll ask you for a list of what has been lost or damaged. \u2022 We might ask you to give us proof you own what you're claiming for and its value. This could be things like a receipt, or valuation you had done. \u2022 We may ask you to prove that your claim happened as you said it did. For example we might need photos, a video or a report from an expert. If we ask for you to give us proof, you must give it to us or we might not be able to pay your claim. You're responsible for paying any costs that are needed to prove your claim. 7 *** How we'll look after your claim If we accept your claim, there are a few ways we",

For example we might need photos, a video or a report from an expert. If we ask for you to give us proof, you must give it to us or we might not be able to pay your claim. You're responsible for paying any costs that are needed to prove your claim. 7 *** How we'll look after your claim If we accept your claim, there are a few ways we can look to put things right. We'll try to repair the damage. \u2022 If we can't repair, we'll try to replace. \u2022 We may pay a cash settlement instead. What else do you need to know? If you have other insurance that also covers what you're claiming for, we'll only pay our share of the claim unless we say otherwise in your policy. If we ask, you must give us details of the other policy. If you don't we might not be able to pay the claim. We use other companies (who we call suppliers) to repair or replace your things, and to repair or rebuild your home. Any repair or rebuild work done by our suppliers is guaranteed for at least 12 months. Where we use suppliers, we might get discounts. We will use their cost to us when settling claims. What we mean is, we won't pay more than it would cost us to repair, replace an item or rebuild any part of your home. We'll replace an item with a new item on a like for like basis. When we say 'like for like basis', we mean we'll try to replace it with an exact match. If we can't find an exact match, we'll replace it with the nearest equivalent. By 'nearest equivalent' we mean an item of the same quality and same specification. If we can't find an exact match or nearest equivalent, we'll decide on how much to pay. This will be based on an expert opinion of how much it was worth before it was lost, stolen or damaged. We will only pay up to \u00a32,000 for any contents item unless it is named on your policy. If you have named the item, we will cover it up to the amount you have specified it for. This does not apply to furniture which isn't antique or a home appliance. You don't need to specify these even if they cost more than \u00a32,000. By 'home appliance' we mean an item used for household tasks, like a washing machine or dishwasher. 8 *** If we decide your buildings need to be repaired, where it's necessary, we'll pay for: \u2022 Architects', surveyors' and legal fees. We must approve the fees first. \u2022 The cost of clearing debris, demolishing buildings, or making them safe. We'll pay the cost of following building regulations and other laws when repairing the damage to your buildings. We won't pay this cost if you were aware that your home did not comply before the damage happened. We might choose to make a payment to you instead of making repairs to your buildings. If we do, the amount we pay will be worked out in one of two ways: 1 We'll either pay you the cost of repairing the damage, but we'll lower the payment to take into account wear and tear. Or, 2 We'll pay the amount the value of your home has fallen by because of the damage. We won't pay more than what it would cost to rebuild it to how it was before the damage. You must let us defend or settle any legal disputes or claims on your behalf. You also must let us take legal action in your name and help us to take legal action if we ask you to. Matching sets and suites Where we've agreed to pay a claim for something that's part of a matching set or suite, we'll always do our best to match it. We'll try to repair the damaged item and, where this isn't possible, we'll look to replace it. We'll carry out thorough searches to make sure that the damaged item is replaced with a reasonable match. This may not be an exact match, but it should look reasonably similar to the rest of the set or suite. This may result in repainting kitchen doors or re-spraying a bathroom sink to match. Where we can't replace the damaged item with a reasonable match, we'll make a cash contribution of 50% towards the cost of replacing the undamaged item forming part of the same set or suite. We won't pay claims for any undamaged items of a uniform nature, colour or",

They will try to settle your claim by negotiation without having to go to court. \u2022 If the appointed Preferred Law Firm cannot negotiate settlement of your claim and it is necessary to go to court and legal proceedings are issued or there is a conflict of interest, then you may choose a law firm to act as the Appointed Representative. \u2022 If you choose a law firm as your Appointed Representative who is not a Preferred Law Firm, we will give your choice of law firm the opportunity to act on the same terms as a Preferred Law Firm. However, if they refuse to act on this basis, the most we will pay is the amount we would have paid if they had agreed to our Standard Terms of Appointment. The amount we will pay a law firm (where acting as the Appointed Representative) is currently \u00a3130 per hour. The amount may vary from time to time. \u2022 The Appointed Representative must co-operate with us at all times and must keep us up to date with the progress of the claim. Offers to Settle a Claim \u2022 You must tell us if anyone offers to settle a claim. You must not negotiate or agree to a settlement without our written consent. \u2022 If you do not accept a reasonable offer to settle a claim, we may refuse to pay further legal costs. \u2022 We may decide to pay you the reasonable value of your claim, instead of starting or continuing legal action. In these circumstances you must allow us to take over and pursue or settle any claim in your name. You must also allow us to pursue at our own expense and for our own benefit, any claim for compensation against any other person and you must give us all the information and help we need to do so. \u2022 Where a settlement is made on a without-costs basis, we will decide what proportion of that settlement will be regarded as Costs and Expenses and payable to us. Your Responsibilities You must co-operate fully with us and the Appointed Representative. \u2022 You must give the Appointed Representative any instructions that we ask you to. Assessing and Recovering Costs \u2022 You must instruct the Appointed Representative to have legal costs taxed, assessed or audited if we ask for this. \u2022 You must take every step to recover Costs and Expenses and court attendance and jury service expenses that we have to pay and must pay us any amounts that are recovered. 32 *** Cancelling an Appointed Representative's Appointment If the Appointed Representative refuses to continue acting for you with good reason, or if you dismiss the Appointed Representative without good reason, the cover we provide will end immediately, unless we agree to appoint another Appointed Representative. Withdrawing Cover If you settle or withdraw a claim without our agreement, or do not give suitable instructions to the Appointed Representative, we can withdraw cover and will be entitled to reclaim from you any Costs and Expenses we have paid. Expert Opinion We may require you to get, at your own expense, an opinion from an expert that we consider appropriate, on",

Alternatively, there is a separate arbitration process. The arbitrator will be a barrister chosen jointly by you and us.
